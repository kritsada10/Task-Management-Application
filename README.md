# Task Management Application

- The task list should have the following functions:
- Group items by date.
- Order groups and items by created date ascending.
- Load 10 items per page and load more data from the API when scrolling to almost reach the
  last item.
- Swipe to delete each item (no need to call API)

- The application should automatically show a passcode lock screen to block the screen when the
  user is inactive for 10 seconds, kills and reopens the application, or closes and reopens the
  application after 10 seconds.
- Users can continue to the main screen without blocking if they close and reopen the application in
  less than 10 seconds.
- The current passcode for testing should be "123456". Implementing a screen for setup or edit
  passcode is a plus.

And Little Unit Test
